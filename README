webgal.rb is a basic static HTML (aka "web") image gallery maker.

webgal.rb depends on the following:

 * Ruby-GNOME2 (http://ruby-gnome2.sourceforge.jp)

 * RMagick (http://rmagick.rubyforge.org/)

 * ImageMagick (http://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php)

 * jhead (http://www.sentex.net/~mwandel/jhead/)

 * exiftran (part of fbida, http://linux.bytesex.org/fbida/)

On a typical GNU/Linux system that's not a lot to worry about. These
are all available on Ubuntu, at least.

This thing might run on Windows. Probably not worth the effort though.

I can't get exiftran to compile on Cygwin, and attempts to build a
gallery on Cygwin are failing anyway.
